          A Jukebox is a block in Minecraft that can be used to play Music Discs. There are 15
          different discs that can be played and the music can be heard about from 70 blocks away.
          The Jukebox has the same texture as a Note Block on it's sides and can be crafted using a
          Diamond and 8 Wooden Planks, as shown above.
